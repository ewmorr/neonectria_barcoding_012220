Repo for sequence processing and ecological analyses of metabarcoding experiment describing distriubtion of *Neonectria* species and associated fungal community in phloem from *Fagus grandifolia* (American beech).

The workflow consists of:
- initial sequence quality control and dada2 algorithm (`sequence_processing_DADA2_README.md`)
- ASV filtering with LULU (`LULU_README.md`)
- read mapping against *Neonectria* ASV representative sequences for maximal detection of *Neonectria* (), and
- ecological analyses (`ecological_analyses_README.md`)
